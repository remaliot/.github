## Fun Facts

üèúÔ∏è The name "Remal" is Arabic for "sand," which is fitting since sand contains silicon, the foundational element used in electronic components that not only powers our IoT devices but is also a cornerstone of all electronics.

üê∂ Remal's mascot is a spirited Border Collie belonging to our founder, Khalid Mansoor AlAwadhi. Named Atlas, this intelligent pup embodies the innovative and energetic spirit of the Remal team.
